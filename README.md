# Overview
This project aims to develop a knowledge-based chatbot to assist technology leaders in staying updated with the latest trends in Fintech, Proptech, ArTech, and Digitalization. The chatbot leverages machine learning and natural language processing to classify user queries and generate relevant responses, reducing the time and effort required for information retrieval.

## Objectives
Classification Model Analysis: Compare various machine learning and deep learning models to select the best model for topic classification.
Chatbot Integration: Explore two response generation methods:
Cosine Similarity Matching: Uses TF-IDF and SVM for structured query handling.
Large Language Model (LLM): Utilizes ZhipuAI's ChatGLM-4 for dynamic and human-like responses.
